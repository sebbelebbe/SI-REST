# SI-REST

## What exactly is REST? How does the context of it fits to the title of the dissertation?   
REST stands for Representation State Transfer.   
I has the possibility to create, read, update and delete information.  
Here is some examples of how to use the different functions.  

###Get:  
HTTP://some.url/cars could fx. return a list of cars.  
HTTP://some.url/cars /1 could return a car mathing the id 1.  

###Delete:  
The URL would be structed the same as get example 2 but instead of returning something it deletes the element.  

###Post and put:  
has a json body that contains the information about what you want to change/create. 
  
It runs on the http protocol.  
  
  
  
## Why is the dissertation considered so important for the software-architectural world?  
I don’t know.  

## Which is the most valuable outcome you personally get from it?   
I like to use REST webservices as a way of communication from 1 or more frontends to a backend because it is easy to use when you get to know it and when you are implementing models in your frontend it is easy to decode a json response to the model.  

### How could you implement it in your own practice as a software developer?  
It don’t think I will work differ with rest then I did befor in the near future.
